Python encrpytion 

Copying and pasting the code and running it will not work
you need to change the path
server_ip , server_port
and the file to write the key in



1)Add a new file with a .key extension so that that file can send 
2)You can add code to change the file after sending the key so that the victim cannot decrypt it
3)change server port and server ip





*IMP*
Dont use this in a real life penetration test as this code is not 100% full proof and it requires changes for it to work in a actual senario 
This is just to see the encryption of files
